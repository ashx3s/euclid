## 23-11-26 Notes

This weekend I've been focused on some of the basic functionality for generating labels and points and assigning their values. the functions included at this point have not been tested yet.

My goal is to build out a few more definitions, enough to be able to draw and start testing the system with

For storing points in memory, I figure I'll use session storage.

### Areas of concern

- that the label/point making system is a disaster
  - I'm concerned that the functions are too broken up and are adding too much complexity
  - that the separation of concerns is not well developed
  - that there will be confusion of when to use which function
- **Plan**: I'm going to revisit this after I've gotten through more of the definitions functions

### Next Steps

- Create more definiton functions
- Add a system of tracking which functions are related to which definitions
  - this should return some basic information
- Test a proof of the first theorem
  - through the first book, I'm going to spend a short amount of time proving the theorems myself and improving my definitions to do so
  - The goal is that for book 2 I won't need to look at the proof as much as I'll be more sure that my functions are doing their jobs correctly
